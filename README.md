# Create a Spotify Data Logger 

Create a data processing file I/O script that reads data from a CSV file containing Spotify data and performs some analysis to complete one or more of the challenges outlined below. 

The project is flexible enough to work with nearly any backend programming language. This README provides an overview of the project and explains how to adapt it to your chosen programming language.

<h2 id="overview">Project Overview</h2>
The project consists of a script that reads data from a CSV file (spotify-2023.csv) and performs the following tasks.

1. Load Spotify data from the CSV file.
2. Create a folder for your project with your github handler. 
3. Complete at least one of the challenges below.
4. Add your folder with your project to the submissions folder of this repo.
5. Include the script that runs your file.

**Note: the project must successfully complete one of the challenges below to qualify for as a submission.**

### Challenges
1. Write a script to identify the number of songs in the file.
2. Write a script that identify the number of songs in the key of E.
3. Count the occurrences of values in a specified column (e.g., artist names) and determine the most common value.

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
Before adapting this project to your chosen programming language, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Backend programming language of your choice.
- A library or method for reading and parsing CSV files, if not built-in to your language of choice.
- The CSV file (spotify-2023.csv) containing Spotify data that you want to analyze. Make sure to adjust the filename and path as needed.
- The script that will run your file to output the results.

The usage instructions will vary depending on your chosen programming language. Below are the general steps to adapt this project:

**Clone or Download:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

**Choose Your Backend Language:** Open the project directory. In the submissions folder, create a new script or file in your chosen backend programming language.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the required prerequisites for your chosen programming language, such as libraries for file I/O and CSV parsing.

**Create Your File I/O Project:** Use the programming language of your choice to create your project and read the data from the CSV file (spotify-2023.csv) and write a script to complete the challenges.

**CSV Parsing:** Use a CSV parsing library or method available in your programming language.

**Data Processing:** Write a script in your chosen programming language that creates methods, processes the data, and adds logic to successfully complete one or more of the coding challenges. 

**Run Your Script:** Execute your adapted script using the appropriate command or method for your backend programming language.
